# Authentication

To verify if an API call is valid, the BBB API uses a checksum system. 

For each incoming API request, the controller computes a checksum out of the combination of the entire HTTPS query string and the serverâ€™s shared secret. It then matches the incoming checksum against the computed checksum. If they match, the controller accepts the incoming request.

To use the security model, you must be able to create an SHA-1 checksum out of the call name plus the query string plus the shared secret that you configured on your server. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Create the entire query string for your API call without the checksum parameter.
    * Example for create meeting API call: name=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444
2. Prepend the API call name to your string
    * Example for above query string:
        * API call name is create
        * String becomes: createname=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444
3. Now, append the shared secret to your string
    * Example for above query string:
        * shared secret is 639259d4-9dd8-4b25-bf01-95f9567eaf4b
        * String becomes: createname=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444639259d4-9dd8-4b25-bf01-95f9567eaf4b
4. Now, find the SHA-1 sum for that string (implementation varies based on programming language).
    * the SHA-1 sum for the above string is: 1fcbb0c4fc1f039f73aa6d697d2db9ba7f803f17
5. Add a checksum parameter to your query string that contains this checksum.
    * Above example becomes: name=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444&checksum=1fcbb0c4fc1f039f73aa6d697d2db9ba7f803f17

You MUST send this checksum with EVERY API call. Since end users do not know your shared secret, they can not fake calls to the server, and they can not modify any API calls since changing a single parameter name or value by only one character will completely change the checksum required to validate the call.
