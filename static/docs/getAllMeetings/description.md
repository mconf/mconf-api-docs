    This is a custom Elos call, which means it is not supported by the standard BigBlueButton API
</div>

This call works as [getMeetings](#operation/getMeetings) but will also return meetings that already ended. Also, it can aggregate the recording info when setting `includeRecordings` to `true`. This is the standard call used to list a history of meetings (including or not their recordings).

### Pagination
This call can be paginated using the `limit` and `offset` parameters.
