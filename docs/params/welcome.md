A welcome message that gets displayed on the chat window when the participant joins. You can include keywords (`%%CONFNAME%%`, `%%DIALNUM%%`, `%%CONFNUM%%`) which will be substituted automatically.

The welcome message has limited support for HTML formatting. Be careful about copy/pasted HTML from e.g. MS Word, as it can easily exceed the maximum supported URL length when used on a GET request.
