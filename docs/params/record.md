Setting `record=true` instructs the BigBlueButton server to record the media and events in the session for later playback.

In order for a playback file to be generated, a moderator must click the Start/Stop Recording button at least once during the sesssion; otherwise, in the absence of any recording marks, the record and playback scripts will not generate a playback file.
