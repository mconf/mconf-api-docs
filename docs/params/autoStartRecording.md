Whether to automatically start recording when first user joins.

When this parameter is `true`, the recording UI in BigBlueButton will be initially active. Moderators in the session can still pause and restart recording using the UI control.

*NOTE: Don’t pass `autoStartRecording=false` and `allowStartStopRecording=false` - the moderator won’t be able to start recording!
